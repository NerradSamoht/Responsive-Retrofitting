<p>Long story short, there&#8217;s still one open sponsorship spot for this week&#8217;s The Talk Show, recording tomorrow (which may well be today by the time you read this) and airing Friday. If you&#8217;ve got a product or service you&#8217;d like to promote to the best podcast audience in the world, <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#116;o:&#x73;&#112;&#111;&#x6E;&#x73;&#x6F;&#x72;&#115;&#64;&#x64;a&#x72;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#x66;&#x69;&#x72;e&#98;&#97;&#108;&#108;&#x2E;&#x6E;&#101;&#116;?subject=The%20Talk%20Show%20Sponsorship">get in touch</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Apple were to launch a $200–300 7.8-inch iPad, they’d probably
sell a <em>ton</em> of them for the holiday season &#8212; which means they’d
need to start ramping up production pretty soon, if not already.
If they were doing that, we’d probably see legitimate-looking
parts leaked from the supply chain by now, but as far as I know,
we haven’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, I&#8217;ve seen at least one purported leak: <a href="http://blog.zoogue.com/ipad/exclusive-ipad-nano-images-surface/">a month ago at a site called ZooGue</a>. No idea if it&#8217;s legitimate, but I like it. It hearkens back to the original iPhone with its flat back and round sides.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> ZooGue link is fireballed, but <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:XOdPTXlcPt8J:blog.zoogue.com/ipad/exclusive-ipad-nano-images-surface/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">Google has it cached</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I&#8217;m hearing it&#8217;s a fake, so take it with at least a few extra grains of salt.</p>

<p>This piece by Horace Dediu explains &#8212; <em>perfectly</em> &#8212; what I was talking about this week with my <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/07/iphone_disruption_five_years_in">iPhone disruption piece</a>. Except what Dediu shows is that the disruption started in 2004, three years before the iPhone shipped. But the introduction of iOS accelerated this disruption dramatically.</p>

<p>Bottom line: In 1984, DOS PCs outsold the Mac 6-to-1. By 2004, the ratio of Windows PCs to Macs sold peaked at 56-to-1. Today it&#8217;s under 20-to-1 and still dropping &#8212; but if you include iOS devices, it&#8217;s down to 2-to-1. Staggering.</p>

<p>Dediu&#8217;s graphs are the best illustration I&#8217;ve ever seen of the waxing and waning of Microsoft&#8217;s Windows hegemony.</p>

<p>Three months ago, here&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/15/baig-ipad-flash">Baig listing the pros and cons for the iPad 3</a> (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pro. Stunning screen, 4G speeds (on certain models), decent
dictation and improved camera optics. Strong battery. Apps galore.</p>

<p>Con. Shooting with camera can be awkward. <strong>No Adobe Flash.</strong> No
camera flash. No expanded storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Baig called out the iPad 3&#8217;s lack of Flash Player support in the article itself, too. No mention of Flash whatsoever in the Nexus 7 review. Funny how <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/29/3125219/flash-mobile-android-4-1-not-supported">the lack of Flash Player support</a> was only a problem with Apple devices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Speaking with The Inquirer, a Google spokesperson confirmed that

remain an exclusive in US for the time being. They said, &#8220;The UK
version will feature all of the options currently available in the
UK Play store&#8221;, which means users of the Nexus 7 will be limited

<p>Rene Ritchie:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Apple can make a 9.7 inch iPad for the same price Apple&#8217;s
competitors can make a 7 inch tablet, how much would it cost Apple
to make a 7 inch tablet?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine a $200 7 inch iPad having huge margins, but
it was hard to imagine a $500 9.7 inch iPad having huge margins in
2010. Now the entry-level 9.7 inch iPad 2 sells for $400.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I bet Apple could make a $199 iPad Mini <em>and</em> turn a profit on it &#8212; especially with a $249 version sitting next to it with double the storage. It&#8217;s that simple. If Apple thinks people would buy a smaller cheaper iPad and that they can turn a profit making them, they&#8217;ll do it. No reason to overthink it.</p>

<p>Keep in mind too that Amazon still only sells the Kindle Fire in the U.S., and Google is only selling the Nexus 7 in three countries &#8212; and outside the U.S. <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2189321/uk-google-nexus-tablets-wont-feature-music-magazines-tv">it won&#8217;t have music, magazines, or TV shows</a>. Even if this iPad Mini doesn&#8217;t ship until October, Apple will likely beat Amazon and Google to market in much of the world.</p>

<p>Peter Burrows and Adam Satariano, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. plans to debut a smaller, cheaper iPad by year-end, two
people with knowledge of the plans said, to help maintain
dominance of the tablet market as Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
prepare competing handheld devices.</p>

<p>The new model will have a screen that’s 7 inches to 8 inches
diagonally, less than the current 9.7-inch version, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because Apple hasn’t made
its plans public. The product, which Apple may announce by
October, won’t have the high-definition screen featured on the
iPad that was released in March, one of the people said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s the logic behind such a display. Displays aren&#8217;t manufactured at their finished size; rather, they&#8217;re made on big sheets, and then cut to size. I believe the iPad Mini (or whatever it&#8217;s going to be called) uses the same display as the iPhone 3GS. So instead of cutting these sheets into 3.5-inch 480&#8201;&#215;&#8201;320 displays for the iPhone 3GS, they&#8217;ll cut them into 7.85-inch 1024&#8201;&#215;&#8201;768 displays for the smaller iPad. Same exact display technology, though &#8212; display technology that Apple has been producing at scale ever since the original iPhone five years ago. These are displays Apple <em>knows</em> they can produce efficiently and in enormous quantities. All they have to do is cut them into bigger pieces.</p>

<p>And then for developers, the iPad Mini acts just like an iPad 1 or 2: same number of pixels, just a little smaller physically. It&#8217;s not a new target.</p>

<p>Visitors to sites like 9to5Mac certainly are not representative of the iOS user base as a whole, but it&#8217;s an interesting statistic nonetheless. Here at DF, 7.75 percent of iOS visitors yesterday were on iOS 6. (83 percent were on 5.1.1, 5 percent on 5.1, 1.6 percent on 5.0.1, and all other versions of iOS were well under half a percent.)</p>

<p>More interesting to me is that iOS now accounts for just under one-third of DF web traffic. These are numbers the past month:</p>

<table>
<tbody>

<tr>
  <td align="left">Macintosh</td>
  <td align="right">51%</td>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eichenwald’s conversations reveal that a management system known
as “stack ranking” &#8212; a program that forces every unit to declare
a certain percentage of employees as top performers, good
performers, average, and poor &#8212; effectively crippled Microsoft’s
ability to innovate. “Every current and former Microsoft employee
I interviewed &#8212; every one &#8212; cited stack ranking as the most
destructive process inside of Microsoft, something that drove out
untold numbers of employees,” Eichenwald writes. “If you were on a
team of 10 people, you walked in the first day knowing that, no
matter how good everyone was, 2 people were going to get a great
review, 7 were going to get mediocre reviews, and 1 was going to
get a terrible review,” says a former software developer. “It
leads to employees focusing on competing with each other rather
than competing with other companies.”</p>

<h6 class="dateline">Monday,  2 July 2012</h6>

<p>Clayton Christensen, author of the deservedly much-praised <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0060521996/ref=nosim/daringfirebal-20">The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma</a></em>, was <a href="http://jeremy.linuxquestions.org/2007/06/28/clayton-christensens-innovators-dilemma-says-iphone-will-fail/">wrong about the iPhone five years ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So music on the mobile phone is going to disrupt the iPod? But
Apple’s just about to launch the iPhone. The iPhone is a
sustaining technology relative to Nokia. In other words, Apple is
leaping ahead on the sustaining curve [by building a better
phone]. But the prediction of the theory would be that Apple won’t
succeed with the iPhone. They’ve launched an innovation that the
existing players in the industry are heavily motivated to beat:
It’s not [truly] disruptive. History speaks pretty loudly on that,
that the probability of success is going to be limited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last month <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/05/14/120514fa_fact_macfarquhar">Larissa MacFarquhar profiled Christensen</a> in The New Yorker (subscribers-only, alas), and in a parenthetical, succinctly explained why he got the iPhone wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One CEO who never asked for his help, despite his admiration for
<em>The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma</em>, was Steve Jobs, which was fortunate,
because Christiansen&#8217;s most embarrassing prediction was that the
iPhone would not succeed. Being a low-end guy, Christiansen saw it
as a fancy cell phone; it was only later that he realized that it
was also disruptive to laptops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This explains everything that has happened to both the computer and phone industries over the past five years. The iPhone is not and never was a phone.<sup id="fnr1-2012-07-02"><a href="#fn1-2012-07-02">1</a></sup> It is a pocket-sized computer that <em>obviates</em> the phone. The iPhone is to cell phones what the Mac was to typewriters.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/blackberry_vs_iphone">I wrote about this back in May 2008</a>, positing that RIM was then already likely screwed because the future of the industry was about making computers, not phones or messaging devices, and RIM had no institutional experience as a computer maker, on either the hardware or software sides of the fence. With Apple, on the other hand, you can more or less look back at the decade preceding the original iPhone as a series of training exercises for what was to come: building portable computers (PowerBooks, iBooks, MacBooks) and pocketable devices (iPods).</p>

<p>The iPod&#8217;s success fooled almost everyone (including me) into thinking that Apple&#8217;s entry into the phone market would be similar. The iPod was the world&#8217;s best portable media player; the &#8220;iPhone&#8221;, thus, would likely be the world&#8217;s best cell phone.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not what it was. It was the world&#8217;s best portable computer. Best not in the sense of being the most powerful, or the fastest, or the most-efficient to use. The thing couldn&#8217;t even do copy-and-paste. It was the best because it was always there, always on, always just a button-push away. The disruption was not that we now finally had a nice phone; it was that, for better or for worse, we would now never again be without a computer or the Internet. It was the Mac side of Apple, not the iPod side, that set the engineering foundation for the iPhone.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s happened over the last five years shows not that Apple disrupted the phone handset industry, but rather that Apple <em>destroyed</em> the handset industry &#8212; by disrupting the computer industry. Today, cell phones are apps, not devices. The companies that were the most successful at selling cell phones pre-iPhone are now <a href="http://www.palm.com/">dead</a> or <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/07/02/rims-tailspin/">dying</a>. Amazon, Google, and now even Microsoft are designing and selling their own integrated touchscreen portable tablets. &#8220;App&#8221; is now a household word.</p>

<p>All of this, because of the iPhone.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘The iPhone and Disruption: Five Years In’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/07/iphone_disruption_five_years_in">&#9733;</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn1-2012-07-02">
<p>I wonder how many people would have formed a different, more accurate, perception of the iPhone and its implications for the future if Apple hadn&#8217;t put &#8220;phone&#8221; in the name. Ken Segall recently revealed that <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/apple/3361300/steve-jobs-silly-apple-names-enemies-rows-with-jony-ive/">one of the first names Apple considered for the iPhone was &#8220;iPad&#8221;</a>, which, if you think about it, is actually a more apt name for the thing. The iPhone is not a phone with other secondary features. It&#8217;s a general purpose pocket-sized touchscreen computer, that happens to include cellular phone networking as a feature.</p>

<p>Marketing-wise, it&#8217;s hard to argue with the iPhone&#8217;s success. And I suspect the misdirection of the &#8220;phone&#8221; in &#8220;iPhone&#8221; helped Apple in this regard. By framing it merely as a cool new phone rather than a revolutionary new computing platform, Apple positioned the iPhone as something people in the mass market already thought they wanted. But I think the &#8220;iPhone&#8221; name also misdirected pundits, analysts, and <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/17002229521/lets-see-how-the-competition-goes-just-to">competing executives</a> who should have known better.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2012-07-02"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Fred Wilson, &#8220;Mobile Is Where The Growth Is&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a significant shift going on this year, much more
significant than we saw last year, from web to mobile. It is most
noticeable in games, social networking, music, and news, but it is
happening across the board and it presents both great opportunity
and great challenges.</p>

<p>Mobile native services like Foursquare and Instagram have the most
to gain from this transition. Big feature rich web apps like
Facebook and Google have the most to lose from this transition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A sea change is indeed underway, but Wilson either misses it or is being obtuse. Companies Wilson mentions: Microsoft, Google, RIM, Facebook, Yahoo. Not mentioned: Apple.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no mystery here. We&#8217;re talking about two platforms: iOS and Android. (Microsoft is doing its best to join that party with Windows 8.) It&#8217;s not &#8220;mobile vs. the web&#8221;. The web is a huge part of what people do on iPhones, iPads, and Android devices. It&#8217;s post-PC vs. PC, in Apple&#8217;s parlance. Modern vs. traditional computing devices. Pretty much every instance of &#8220;mobile&#8221; could be replaced by &#8220;modern&#8221; in Wilson&#8217;s piece, and it would read better.</p>

<p>Horace Dediu illustrates RIM&#8217;s decline.</p>

<p>By the numbers, Nokia looks like it&#8217;s on a similar trajectory, but there&#8217;s one key difference: Nokia has their next-generation phones on the market. It doesn&#8217;t seem like the Lumia handsets are setting the world on fire, but at least they have a chance. With RIM&#8217;s next-generation phones not coming until 2013, they&#8217;ve got no chance.</p>

  <p>Edge swiping to switch between tabs works great and hopefully will
make its way into other iOS apps in the future. Switching between
tabs on the iPad is even better, as you can switch between
multiple tabs with a single swipe. Opening a new tab instantly
refreshes the tab, showing you the old version of the page in
black and white until the new one is available. Sounds pretty
great. So, why switch back to Safari? Here’s why.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with pretty much everything in this review. Chrome&#8217;s experience is all about the omnibox. Me, I actually make pretty heavy use of bookmarks (and bookmarklets), so it makes a big difference to me that Safari puts those one tap away. Especially on the phone, I prefer tapping to typing.</p>

<p>My thanks to Tapstream for sponsoring this week&#8217;s DF RSS feed. Tapstream is a new tool for iOS, Mac, and Android developers that lets you understand how users are finding your app, and measure which social networks, websites, and marketing campaigns are driving traffic. It&#8217;s super-easy to implement: just add a snippet of JavaScript to your website and add their SDK to your app. That&#8217;s it. This week only, DF readers who install Tapstream&#8217;s SDK get a lifetime Pro account for free (regular price: $40 per month).</p>

<p>My favorite part: Tapstream was built by app developers for app developers, and <a href="https://tapstream.com/?df">one of the ways they tested it</a> was to measure the effectiveness of a Daring Fireball RSS feed sponsorship. The result: they booked two more DF sponsorships.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s easy to figure out why Apple doesn’t want default third-party
apps. It would cede control of the iOS experience to
third-parties. Imagine a Google user with an iPhone replacing most
of the core apps with Google counterparts. An iPhone home screen
with Chrome, Gmail, Drive, Docs, Calendar, Contacts, Music, Maps,
Listen, Now, and Google+ is Apple’s worst nightmare. Unhappy
iPhone users who would like to use Google services in a more
integrated manner and can’t are also Apple’s worst nightmare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, Apple&#8217;s worst nightmare is someone buying an Android phone instead of an iPhone. If you buy an iPhone, Apple wins, that&#8217;s all there is to it. Every iOS user who chooses to use a third-party app as their preferred client for web browsing, email, calendaring, etc. is annoyed every single time they click a web/email/event URL and are taken to an iOS system app that they don&#8217;t want to use.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t annoy users&#8221; is a good rule of thumb, and the inability to specify third-party apps as default handlers for these things is annoying.</p>

<p>If Apple does not want iOS users to use Chrome (to name one example), they should not have allowed it into the App Store. If they allowed it into the App Store, then they should allow it to be specified as the default browser.</p>

<p>Conrad MacIntyre:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suspect the reason is because of the deep system integration of
things like Safari, Mail, Contacts, and the like. Take Mail, for
example, if you could set Sparrow as your default client on iOS
you&#8217;d still have to configure Mail because any email sent from
other apps uses the Mail API. Then rely on IMAP to sync those
things up. Inelegant and un-Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s a good point about email, but it doesn&#8217;t apply to web browsing. There is no &#8220;Safari&#8221; sheet in iOS. And even for email, the answer is that iOS should allow third-party apps &#8212; like Sparrow &#8212; to provide their own system-wide sharing sheets.</p>

<p>No doubt in my mind that this is one of the big problems to be solved for the industry over the next decade, and Bray&#8217;s two-point bullet list is exactly right: the username/password solution is bad for users in numerous ways, but whatever eventually replaces it needs to be <em>easy</em> for developers.</p>

<h6 class="dateline">Wednesday, 20 June 2012</h6>

<p>Watching <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3096420/microsoft-surface-event-video-live/in/2859835">the Microsoft Surface event video</a>, I sensed uneasiness. Not panic, but discomfort. Some will argue that I&#8217;m simply spoiled by Apple&#8217;s on-stage polish, but Monday&#8217;s Microsoft event struck me as rushed and severely under-rehearsed. Ballmer offered nothing but blustering bromides, and nothing even vaguely resembling a coherent answer to the big question: Why? Steven Sinofsky was nervous and hurried. It didn&#8217;t help that his first Surface RT unit <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/video-surface-vs-ipad-microsofts-getting-rusty-at-stealing-from-apple.php">crashed before he&#8217;d done anything other than wake it up</a>. There was a moment where he said Surface was perfect for sitting down, relaxing in a chair, and watching a movie. He sat in that chair for about three seconds before rushing into the next segment.</p>

<p>I found the presenters far less rehearsed and the presentation far less cohesive than an Apple event. (With the notable exception of designer Panos Panay, who was very solid on stage.) There was no story. It was all over the place: <em>Here&#8217;s an ARM tablet. Here&#8217;s the clever keyboard cover that goes with it. Now here&#8217;s another tablet that looks much the same but a little thicker but in fact is running a different and incompatible OS. Oh and here&#8217;s another keyboard cover, this one with moving keys.</em> Design is about making decisions, and Microsoft could not decide. ARM or Intel? Who should be on stage? Soft or hard keys on the keyboard cover? They went with &#8220;all of the above&#8221;.</p>

<p>The only hard decision they made was the big one: to turn against their OEM hardware partners.</p>

<p>I presume Microsoft timed this event to jump ahead of anything Google might be announcing at their I/O conference next week &#8212; and the consensus seems to be that Google is going to announce much the same idea: their own Google-branded, Google-designed tablet that will put them in direct competition not just with Apple but with their own OS licensees.</p>

<p>But no pricing, no battery life specs, no demonstrations of the seemingly extraordinarily clever cover-keyboards in action, or really much in the way of software demonstrations, period? That&#8217;s rough, even by the standards of pre-announcements. Skepticism about these things doesn&#8217;t require knee-jerk Apple fandom. It simply requires an open set of eyeballs. The message I took away is that Microsoft has concluded that, ready or not, it needed to move now. There is no longer enough profit to be had selling software alone.</p>

<hr />

<p>Remember <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-announces-ipad/id275834665?i=80469507">the introduction of the original iPad</a> at the end of January 2010? The only product Steve Jobs talked about on stage was the iPad, but the presentation was about much more. Jobs opened by talking about Apple having crossed the $50 billion annual revenue threshold. (They&#8217;ve since gone on to cross the $100 billion threshold.) And they spent a large part of the event talking about the iPad&#8217;s integrated system-on-a-chip, the A4. I concluded <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/ipad_big_picture">my take on the event</a> thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They’re Microsoft and Intel rolled into one when it comes to
mobile computing. In the pre-taped video Apple showed, Bob
Mansfield said of the iPad, “No one else could do it.” Only Apple.</p>

<p>And so my takeaway from this &#8212; with the bragging about making
their own CPUs and their annual revenue and their size compared
to companies like Sony, Samsung, and Nokia &#8212; is that this is
Apple’s way of asserting that they’re taking over the penthouse
suite as the strongest and best company in the whole
ones-and-zeroes racket.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, it&#8217;s now clear, was correct. If anything, it was understated &#8212; Apple is now the strongest and most successful company in the world, across any and all industries.</p>

<p>If not for the iPad &#8212; imagine, for a moment, that the company still to this day had not shipped a tablet &#8212; Apple would still be thriving, based on huge (and hugely profitable) iPhone sales and the Mac&#8217;s steady continuing growth (six years of consecutive quarterly growth ahead of the overall PC industry). But it was the iPad that pushed Apple over the top. The iPhone suggested Apple would dominate pocket computing. The iPad suggests Apple will dominate computing, period.</p>

<p>Microsoft this week showed itself willing to do what was once unthinkable: design and sell its own PC hardware. This is a profound change of direction for Microsoft and the entire PC industry. The iPad, however, has been out for so long and has been so successful that no one seemed shocked by Microsoft&#8217;s announcement. But make no mistake: for better or for worse, Surface marks a watershed moment in PC industry history.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/214917669491720192">Harry McCracken</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After 37 years, Microsoft agrees with Alan Kay: &#8220;People who are
really serious about software should make their own hardware.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ever-astute Lessien, tweeting <a href="https://twitter.com/Lessien/status/214893940854374403">shortly after Microsoft&#8217;s event</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft&#8217;s move today suggests it feared the irretrievable loss
of the tablet market to iPad, if it continued to rely on
third-party OEMs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d go further, and argue they fear losing not just the tablet market, but the PC market as a whole. Not in sheer numbers, but in sheer <em>profit</em>. Apple doesn&#8217;t want to sell all of the world&#8217;s computers and phones; rather, Apple wants to reap all the profits in the computer and phone industries. There is no threat that Windows goes away, but there is a serious threat that Microsoft&#8217;s profit from Windows greatly diminishes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/06/20/who-will-be-microsofts-tim-cook/">Horace Dediu, today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we simply divide revenues by PCs sold we get about $55 Windows
revenues per PC and $68 of Office revenues per PC sold. The
total income for Microsoft per PC sold is therefore about $123. If
we divide operating income by PCs as well we get $35 per Windows
license and $43 per Office license. That’s a total of $78 of
operating profit per PC.</p>

<p>Now let’s think about a post-PC future exemplified by the iPad.
Apple sells the iPad with a nearly 33% margin but at a higher
average price than Microsoft’s software bundle. Apple gives away
the software (and apps are very cheap) but it still gains $195 in
operating profit per iPad sold.</p>

<p>Fine, you say, but Microsoft make up for it in volume. Well,
that’s a problem. The tablet volumes are expanding very quickly
and are on track to overtake traditional PCs while traditional PCs
are likely to be disrupted and decline.</p>

<p>So Microsoft faces a dilemma. Their business model of expensive
software on cheap hardware is not sustainable. The future is
nearly free software integrated into moderately priced hardware.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There we have it: four short paragraphs that explain why Microsoft has turned its guns against PC-making OEMs. This move was driven by the iPad, but competitively it directly pits Microsoft not against Apple but against Dell, HP, Toshiba, et al. The intention is obviously to slow the iPad down, but the radical shift in Microsoft&#8217;s strategy is about the fight over the profits that remain after Apple&#8217;s. The math no longer works out for the Windows <em>you-sell-the-hardware-we-sell-the-software</em> model. It works for unit share (cf. Android), but it doesn&#8217;t for profit share. Nothing works sustainably in business without profit &#8212; profit is the oxygen companies breathe.</p>

<p>Even if Apple&#8217;s growth soon slows, Apple already reaps a massive share of the industry&#8217;s profits. And if Apple&#8217;s growth <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> slow in the next year or two, look out. All of Apple&#8217;s competitors in the phone industry, save Samsung, are now starving for profit. They&#8217;re dying, all of them &#8212; HTC is breaking even and the rest are deep in the red.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/04/ipad_sales_context">The iPad is growing faster than the iPhone</a>. The Mac already owns the $999-and-over market (where the margins are), and the iPad owns the tablet market (where the growth is). The PC market is quickly heading to where the phone market already is.</p>

<p>Microsoft Surface is <em>not</em> fundamentally about Microsoft needing to control the entire integrated product in order to compete with the iPad on design. It&#8217;s about Microsoft needing to sell the whole thing to sustain its current profitability.</p>

<p>Surface is a bold move, and classic Microsoft. If the OEMs don&#8217;t like it &#8212; <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/19/us-microsoft-windows-tablets-asia-idUSBRE85I1NL20120619">and they do not</a> &#8212; what are they going to do? Turn to Linux (which no one wants) or Android (which no one wants on anything other than phones)? It&#8217;s the OEMs whom Microsoft thinks Surface can put into checkmate, not Apple.</p>

<p>If I&#8217;m right, it&#8217;s inevitable now that Microsoft will acquire Nokia.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Surface: Between a Rock and a Hardware Place’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/06/surface_between_rock_and_hardware_place">&#9733;</a></p>

<h6 class="dateline">Monday, 11 June 2012</h6>

<h2>1.</h2>

<p>On the software side, Apple has &#8212; dare I say <em>finally</em> &#8212; become a company that can walk and chew gum at the same time. Remember back in 2007 when Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) was delayed six months because, <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/04/12/apple-announces-leopard-delays-due-to-the-iphone/">Apple flat-out admitted</a>, they had to pull engineering talent from Mac OS X to work on iOS 1 for the original iPhone? They don&#8217;t seem to have that problem any more.</p>

<p>Today, Apple has two OSes that are both in active concurrent development. Year-over-year, it&#8217;s hard to say which OS has seen the most improvement.</p>

<h2>2.</h2>

<p>The new &#8220;next-generation&#8221; MacBook Pro with Retina Display is, in short, &#8220;Back to the Mac&#8221; for hardware. This is an iOS-inspired appliance &#8212; battery, RAM, solid state storage &#8212; all of it is sealed in a magnificent enclosure. Consider too that it no longer even says &#8220;MacBook Pro&#8221; on the front of the display. It&#8217;s just like an iOS device &#8212; a brilliant display surrounded by black glass.</p>

<p>I have a review unit from Apple, and after just 15 minutes or so trying it out, it&#8217;s damn impressive. Much like with the iPhone and iPad, it&#8217;s not so much that the retina display looks good as that, after you&#8217;ve used it for even just a few minutes, non-retina display MacBooks look bad. It&#8217;s not just pixel size, either &#8212; color, brightness, viewing angles &#8212; everything about it is amazing. Best display I&#8217;ve ever seen, period.</p>

<p>The catch is that it&#8217;s expensive. That&#8217;s why it debuted alongside a brand-new update to the 15-inch non-retina MacBook Pro, rather than replacing it. If you can afford it (and don&#8217;t need the optical drive or spinning hard disk), you want the new one. And surely we&#8217;re going to see displays of this caliber roll out across the MacBook line, one by one, as soon as it becomes economically feasible. (And, I presume, the iMac and Cinema Displays, too. It&#8217;s just a matter of time.)</p>

<p>Best to compare it to the original MacBook Air from 2008. The first Air was expensive and not for everyone, but it showed the future of Apple&#8217;s (and, really, the industry&#8217;s) portables. That&#8217;s what the new 15-inch MacBook Pro is: the future of portable Macs.</p>

<h2>3.</h2>

<p>Starting with the opening gag with Siri doing stand-up comedy and continuing through to Apple&#8217;s new maps and Siri&#8217;s new features, there was an unmistakeable &#8220;Fuck you, Google&#8221; undertone to the whole keynote. Apple is forcing Google out of iOS. Even the Facebook integration feels like a &#8220;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&#8221; alliance.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/29/google-android-profits">said it before</a> and will say it again: Google made a mistake by deciding to oppose rather than ally with Apple on mobile.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Three Takeaways From Today’s WWDC Keynote’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/06/three_takeaways_wwdc">&#9733;</a></p>
